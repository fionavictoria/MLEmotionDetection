The Medical Internet of Things, a recent technological advancement in medicine, is incredibly helpful in providing real-time monitoring of human health metrics. This paper presents a non-invasive IoT system that tracks patients' emotions, especially those with an autism spectrum disorder. With a few affordable sensors and cloud computing services, the individual's heart rates are monitored and analyzed to study the effects of change in sweat and heartbeats per minute for different emotions. Under normal resting conditions of the individual, the system could detect the right emotion using machine learning algorithms. Models developed using these underlying algorithms have a performance of up to 92% accuracy.
